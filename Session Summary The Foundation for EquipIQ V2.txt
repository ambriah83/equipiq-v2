Session Summary: The Foundation for EquipIQThis was a high-leverage session where we pivoted from a complex idea to a lean, high-value product. We have successfully laid the entire strategic and technical foundation for the EquipIQ MVP.Key Accomplishments:Strategic Pivot: We abandoned the "rebuild a better Limble" approach and focused on a high-margin, AI-first intelligence layer. This was the most critical decision we made.Product Definition: We created a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) that defines the product's vision, user journeys, and non-negotiable design standards.Technical Architecture: We designed a professional-grade system architecture, including:A secure, multi-tenant database schema in Supabase with Row-Level Security.A state-of-the-art Hybrid RAG pipeline for the AI's knowledge core.MVP User Interface: We built a functional, production-quality React application that includes:A robust, fail-safe authentication flow that solves the "white screen" issue.A premium, "Apple-inspired" dark mode UI with a complete application shell.Functional image upload and interactive components for AI disambiguation.Next Steps for Our New Chat:Our next sprint will focus on bringing the AI to life and connecting it to the real world.Implement the RAG Pipeline: Build the Supabase Edge Function that performs the hybrid search across our knowledge base.Connect the AI Brain: Replace the placeholder callGeminiAPI function in the UI with a real call to our new Edge Function.Build the Limble Handoff: Create the Edge Function that creates a ticket in Limble when the AI escalates an issue.
