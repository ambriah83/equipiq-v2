1. High-Level Architecture (Supabase Edition)Using Supabase changes the architecture for the better. It consolidates the backend.Frontend (The Prototype): No change. The React application we've built.Supabase (Your Core Backend): This is now the heart of the system.Postgres Database: Your source of truth. We will define the necessary tables below. You already have your knowledge base documents here; we will add tables for jobs, feedback, etc.Auth: Use Supabase's built-in authentication to manage user roles (Admin, Curator, Reviewer).Auto-Generated APIs: Supabase provides instant REST and real-time APIs for any table you create. We will use these for most GET requests.Row Level Security (RLS): This is non-negotiable. Use RLS policies on every table to ensure users can only access the data they are permitted to see.Supabase Edge Functions (The Workhorse): For any custom or sensitive logic that can't be handled by the auto-generated API, we will use serverless Edge Functions. This replaces the need for a separate, always-on backend service.Example: The "Start Fine-Tuning Job" action will call an Edge Function. This function will then push a job to an async task runner.Async Task Runner (Still Necessary): For the actual fine-tuning process, which can take hours. A Supabase Edge Function will add a job to a queue (like RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, or a simpler solution like a dedicated table in your DB that a worker polls). A separate, long-running worker process (hosted wherever you prefer, e.g., on a single server or a service like AWS Fargate) will execute these jobs.2. Supabase Implementation PlanThis replaces the generic API contract. This is what your team needs to build in Supabase.Database TablesCreate these tables in your Supabase project.jobsid (uuid, primary key)name (text)base_model (text)status (text, e.g., 'pending', 'running', 'completed', 'failed')trained_on_tags (array of text)created_at (timestampz)duration_ms (integer)modelsid (uuid, primary key)job_id (foreign key to jobs.id)name (text)accuracy (float)cost_per_1k_tokens (float)latency_ms (integer)is_live (boolean)feedbackid (uuid, primary key)rating (integer, 1-5)query (text)response (text)comment (text, nullable)created_at (timestampz)case_id (foreign key to improvement_cases.id, nullable)improvement_casesid (uuid, primary key)feedback_id (foreign key to feedback.id)query (text)bad_response (text)suggested_response (text)status (text, 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected')Supabase Edge FunctionsCreate these functions in your supabase/functions directory.create-improvement-caseTrigger: Called by the frontend when a user clicks "Create Case".Input: { feedbackId: "..." }Logic:Retrieves the bad query and response from the feedback table.Calls a powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4o via API) with a prompt to generate a better answer.Creates a new record in the improvement_cases table with the result and status: 'pending'.Updates the original feedback record to link to the new case.start-fine-tune-jobTrigger: Called by the frontend when a user clicks "Start Job" in the configuration modal.Input: { name: "...", baseModel: "...", tags: ["..."] }Logic:Creates a new record in the jobs table with status: 'pending'.Pushes the job_id and configuration to your async task queue (e.g., SQS).Returns the job_id to the frontend.approve-improvement-caseTrigger: Called when a user clicks "Approve".Input: { caseId: "..." }Logic:Updates the improvement_cases record status to 'approved'.Crucially: The approved query and suggested_response now become part of the training dataset for future jobs. You can handle this by adding them to a dedicated training_examples table or by flagging them to be pulled by your async worker.This is the concrete plan. Your team can start building these tables and functions immediately.
