ðŸ”´ Level 1 Blockers: Core Functionality & Trust
These are non-negotiable issues that directly impact the product's primary function and user trust.

Incomplete AI Integration in the Frontend:

Problem: The main chat interface in src/App.jsx still calls the old ask-equip-iq-v2 function. It does not use the far more powerful hybrid-rag-search function, nor does it pass the required equipment_model_id to get context-specific answers.

Impact: Your core value propositionâ€”getting specific answers about specific equipmentâ€”is not functional in the UI. The RAG pipeline exists but is orphaned.

Action Step: Modify the getBotResponse function in src/App.jsx to call the hybrid-rag-search Supabase function. Pass the selectedEquipment ID to the function call.

Manual Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline:

Problem: The KnowledgeBaseManager.jsx component allows admins to upload documents. This triggers a generate-embedding function, but the text is limited to the first 8,000 characters. For any real manual, this is insufficient. The ingest-knowledge function, which properly chunks documents, is not being used by the frontend.

Impact: You cannot ingest real-world equipment manuals effectively, crippling your AI's knowledge before it even starts.

Action Step: Refactor the handleFileUpload function in KnowledgeBaseManager.jsx to call the ingest-knowledge Edge Function instead of generate-embedding. This will process the full document text in properly sized chunks.

ðŸŸ¡ Level 2 Gaps: Scaling & Competitive Edge
These issues will prevent you from scaling past a single-user demo and competing effectively.

Feedback Loop is Not Closed:

Problem: You've built an excellent feedback and improvement case system (MessageFeedback.jsx, ImprovementCaseManager.jsx, 002_fine_tuning_system.sql). However, there is no fine-tuning job runner implemented. Approved cases are correctly stored in the training_examples table, but nothing ever uses that data.

Impact: The "learning loop," a key feature you've designed, is currently a dead end. The system cannot get smarter over time.

Action Step: Create the "Async Task Runner" mentioned in your Knowledge Base_Gemini.txt document. This worker needs to:

Poll the fine_tuning_jobs table for 'pending' jobs.

Fetch all approved examples from the training_examples table.

Execute a fine-tuning job via the OpenAI (or other) API.

Update the ai_models table with the new model ID upon completion.

Hardcoded Admin Access:

Problem: The admin check in AdminDashboard.jsx is user?.email === 'ambriahatcher@gmail.com'. This is brittle and unscalable.

Impact: You cannot onboard new companies or delegate admin tasks. This is a critical blocker for any multi-tenant or team-based product.

Action Step: Implement the role-based access control (RBAC) you've designed in 20250716_create_rag_schema.sql. Create a function is_admin() in Supabase and call it from the frontend to determine user roles based on the profiles table, not a hardcoded email.

ðŸŸ¢ Level 3 Enhancements: Polish & Professionalism
These are smaller, but important, details that separate a prototype from a professional product.

Missing UI Feedback:

Problem: The UI lacks loading states for most async operations (e.g., fetching equipment after selecting a location). The user is left wondering if the system is working.

Impact: The application feels unresponsive and can lead to user confusion or repeated clicks.

Action Step: Add loading spinners and disable dropdowns while data is being fetched in ChatInterface within App.jsx. Provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions that trigger a backend call.

No Error Boundaries:

Problem: There are no error boundaries in your React components. A single JavaScript error in a component can crash the entire application.

Impact: A minor, non-critical bug could render the entire platform unusable for a user.

Action Step: Implement a top-level React Error Boundary around your main App component to catch unexpected errors and display a graceful fallback UI instead of a white screen.

Updated Strategic Roadmap
Your immediate priority is to make the core product loop functional.

Sprint 1 (This Week): Achieve End-to-End Core Functionality.

Goal: A user can select a piece of equipment, ask a specific question, and get an answer from the knowledge base for that specific machine.

Tasks: Fix the frontend API call to use hybrid-rag-search and fix the file upload to use ingest-knowledge.

Sprint 2 (Next Week): Implement Scalable User & Knowledge Management.

Goal: You can onboard a new user and they can manage their own knowledge base.

Tasks: Implement true Role-Based Access Control. Test the full knowledge ingestion pipeline with a complete, multi-page manual.

Sprint 3: Close the Learning Loop.

Goal: The system can improve itself based on user feedback.

Tasks: Build and deploy the async worker for running fine-tuning jobs.

You have all the necessary components designed and, in many cases, already built. The task now is to connect them correctly. Focus on the Level 1 Blockers immediately.
