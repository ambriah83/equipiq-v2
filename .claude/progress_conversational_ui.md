# EquipIQ V2 - Conversational UI Implementation

## Date: January 18, 2025

## Objective
Transform EquipIQ from a static checklist-based chatbot to a dynamic, conversational diagnostic expert following the "Expert Technician Framework" outlined by Gemini.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Transformed ask-equip-iq-v2 to Conversational Engine
- **File**: `supabase/functions/ask-equip-iq-v2/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Switched from Gemini to OpenAI GPT-4o for better JSON mode support
  - Implemented structured JSON responses with `response` and `quick_replies`
  - Added "Expert Technician Framework" system prompt with 6 core directives:
    1. Acknowledge & Align (Empathy First)
    2. Clarify & Confirm (One Question at a Time)
    3. Diagnose & Act (The Interactive Loop)
    4. Use Your Knowledge (RAG integration)
    5. Generate Quick Replies (2-4 options)
    6. Intelligent Escalation (Golden Handoff)
  - Integrated with hybrid-rag-search for context-aware responses
  - Added equipment name context to personalize interactions

### 2. Rebuilt Frontend for Conversational Flow
- **File**: `src/App.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Created new message components: `BotMessage`, `UserMessage`, `TypingIndicator`
  - Added quick reply buttons that appear with bot responses
  - Implemented conversational state management
  - Added typing indicator for better UX
  - Maintained existing features:
    - Limble integration for location/equipment selection
    - Image upload capabilities
    - Dark mode support
    - Admin access controls

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Conversational Message Format
```javascript
{
  role: 'assistant',
  content: 'Message text here',
  quickReplies: ['Option 1', 'Option 2', 'Option 3']
}
```

### 2. Quick Reply Buttons
- Appear below bot messages
- Blue rounded buttons with hover effects
- Click to send pre-written responses
- Disappear after user sends a message

### 3. Stateful Conversation Flow
- Messages array tracks full conversation history
- API receives entire conversation context
- Bot maintains awareness of previous interactions

### 4. Expert Technician Persona
- Empathetic acknowledgment of problems
- Single, focused questions
- Guided diagnostic process
- Professional escalation when needed

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

1. **Deploy ask-equip-iq-v2 Function**
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy ask-equip-iq-v2
   ```

2. **Set OpenAI API Key**
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

3. **Create Equipment Type Mapping**
   - Currently using equipment IDs as type IDs (temporary)
   - Need proper mapping between Limble equipment and knowledge base types

4. **Test Conversational Flows**
   - Test empathy responses
   - Verify quick replies work correctly
   - Check diagnostic step progression
   - Test escalation scenarios

5. **Enhance Image Processing**
   - Ensure image data is passed to ask-equip-iq-v2
   - Add image analysis to system prompt

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Flow
1. Frontend sends messages array + equipment context
2. ask-equip-iq-v2 receives request
3. Calls hybrid-rag-search for relevant knowledge
4. Constructs system prompt with Expert Technician Framework
5. OpenAI GPT-4o generates JSON response
6. Returns structured response with quick_replies

### Frontend Flow
1. User selects location and equipment
2. Conversational welcome message appears
3. User types or clicks quick reply
4. Message added to conversation
5. Bot response with new quick replies
6. Continuous diagnostic loop

## Benefits of New Approach

1. **Natural Conversation**: Feels like talking to a real technician
2. **Guided Experience**: Quick replies keep users on track
3. **Contextual Awareness**: Full conversation history maintained
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: One question at a time
5. **Professional Escalation**: Smooth handoff when AI can't help

## Migration Notes

- Old ask-equip-iq-v2 used Gemini, new version uses OpenAI
- Frontend now expects structured JSON responses
- Quick replies are optional but recommended
- System maintains backward compatibility with image uploads

## Summary
Successfully transformed EquipIQ from a static Q&A bot to a conversational diagnostic expert. The new system provides a more natural, guided experience that mirrors talking to a world-class technician. Users can now have dynamic conversations with contextual quick replies, making troubleshooting faster and more intuitive.
