Product Requirements Document: EquipIQ AI Maintenance AssistantVersion: 1.4 (Session End)Author: Gemini (in collaboration with Founder)Date: July 15, 2025Status: Baseline for Next Session1. Executive SummaryFrontline staff at physical locations lack the specialized knowledge to perform immediate equipment repairs, leading to significant operational downtime. This document outlines the requirements for EquipIQ, an AI-driven intelligence layer that integrates with Limble CMMS. EquipIQ empowers on-site staff to resolve issues instantly, transforming our operational model from reactive maintenance to proactive, AI-guided self-service.2. Strategic Goals & ObjectivesNorth Star Metric: Achieve a First Contact Resolution (FCR) Rate of >30%.Business Goal: Reduce reliance on external maintenance vendors, leading to a >20% reduction in associated spend.User Goal: Enable any staff member to confidently diagnose and fix Tier 1-2 problems in minutes via a simple, intuitive chat interface.3. Design System & Aesthetics (Apple-Inspired)The application must adhere to a strict, minimalist, and premium design language.Typography:Font: "Inter", loaded from Google Fonts.Hierarchy: h1 (3xl, bold), h2 (2xl, semibold), p (base).Color Palette:Background: #F9F9F9 (slate-50). Dark: #1C1C1E (zinc-900).Primary Text: #1D1D1F (gray-900). Dark: #F2F2F7 (gray-50).Secondary Text: #86868B (gray-500). Dark: #8E8E93 (zinc-400).Accent/Interactive: #007AFF (vibrant blue).Containers/Cards: #FFFFFF with shadow-md and rounded-lg. Dark: #2C2C2E (zinc-800).Status: Green (#34C759), Yellow (#FFCC00), Red (#FF3B30).Animations & Interactivity (The "Feel"):Library: framer-motion.Speed: All animations must be fast (<200ms) and purposeful.Feedback: Every interactive element must provide immediate visual feedback (hover, focus, active states).4. Core Features & Requirements4.1. The AI Diagnostic Assistant (The Core Experience)The primary interface is a chat application powered by the Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash).Multi-Modal Input: Users can interact via text, voice, static image uploads, and short video clip uploads.Proactive AI Suggestions: The AI is an active command center. When it determines a logical next step (e.g., creating a ticket), it will present this as a clear, actionable button within the chat interface."Escape Hatch" Command: If a user types "create a ticket," the AI will bypass diagnostics and immediately present a simple form to create a ticket manually.Disambiguation Logic: If a query is ambiguous (e.g., "the bed is broken" in a location with 10 beds), the AI must respond with: "To help, I need to know which bed you're referring to. Please select from the list below:" followed by a list of buttons for each relevant piece of equipment.4.2. The AI Knowledge Core (Hybrid RAG Architecture)System Architecture: A Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture will be used to maximize accuracy.Hybrid Search & Synthesis: The system performs two searches in parallel (Keyword for exact matches, Vector for concepts). The results are passed to a final AI Agent Layer to synthesize a single, coherent, and trustworthy answer.The Learning Loop: A confirmed successful chat resolution is converted into a new, validated "chunk" and added to the knowledge base, making the system smarter with every interaction.4.3. Deep Integration with Limble CMMSContextual Handoff: When escalating to Limble, the ticket must include a link to the full AI chat history.Mirrored Ticket Dashboard: The platform will feature a "Tickets" view that is a read-only mirror of the user's tickets in Limble.AI-Powered Ticket Summarization: On the mirrored dashboard, a "âœ¨ Summarize with AI" button will appear next to each ticket. When clicked, this sends the ticket's activity log to the Gemini API and displays a concise, one-sentence summary of the current status and next required action.4.4. User & Company ManagementUser Roles:Owner: Full CRUD access. Can see Billing.Manager: CRUD access within their assigned locations.Staff: Read-only access to most data. Primary permission is to use the AI Chat and create tickets.Data Integrity: Row-Level Security in Supabase will enforce that a user in Company A can never see data from Company B.5. Out of Scope (Version 1.0)Full, editable ticket and equipment detail pages. We will leverage Limble for this and provide value through our intelligence layer.Live, real-time AI video analysis during a call.6. Success MetricsPrimary KPI: First Contact Resolution (FCR) Rate.Secondary KPIs:Reduction in tickets created per location.Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR).User Satisfaction Score (from post-chat feedback).Adoption rate of the "Summarize with AI" feature.
